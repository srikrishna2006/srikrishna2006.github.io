Odometry explanation

static double left_turns = 0.0;
static double right_turns = 0.0;
static double theta = 0.0;
static double x = 0.0;
static double y = 0.0;

//printf("Static %f %f %f %f, %f\n", left_turns, right_turns, theta, x, y);

// Get the turns from the encoder
double dleft = Left.position(turns);
double dright = Right.position(turns);

// Get the number of turns in the current cycle
// which is equal to current turns - previous turns
dleft -= left_turns;
dright -= right_turns;

// Store the total number of turns so far 
left_turns += dleft;
right_turns += dright;

// Use the formula to calculate the left and the right distance
// and the delta theta
double leftDist = dleft * PI * WHDIA;
double rightDist = dright * PI * WHDIA;
double dtheta = (leftDist - rightDist)/(2*RW);


// update the theta with delta theta and 
// fix the upper and lower bound


// Calculate distance and dx, dy
double dist = (rightDist + leftDist)/2;
double dy = dist * cos(theta + dtheta/2);
double dx = dist * sin(theta + dtheta/2);

// Update the robot x, y value with deltaX, deltaY
x += dx;
y += dy;

theta +=dtheta;
if (theta > 2*PI)
{
  theta -= (2*PI);
}
if (theta < -(2*PI))
{
  theta += (2*PI);
}
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/srikrishna2006/srikrishna2006.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
